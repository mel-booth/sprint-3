What is your site's primary purpose?

The purpose of mel-booth.github.io is to document my experiences and learnings as I make my way through EDA. I also see it as a tool to help me reflect on the what I do well, what I do not so well and help me (and maybe others) grow and learn along the way. I imagine as I progress further through EDA this site will form the foundations of my portfolio so I'll be keeping that in mind as I update it.

Who is your target audience?

Presently, myself, my cohort and my EDA teachers and facilitators. Eventually, my target audience may broaden to prospective employers.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want people to be able to navigate seamlessly throughout my blog pages and projects. I'd like there to be a clear journey on my page from day one through to the present, but I'd also like people to be able to jump to posts or projects that might be of the most interest to them. I want to minimise load times and make sure that it looks clean from multiple devices.

How will you build your site to support your desired experience?

I'd like to keep it simple. Clean, easy to navigate, a site that feels good to use whether on a laptop or on a phone. Uncluttered but interesting.
